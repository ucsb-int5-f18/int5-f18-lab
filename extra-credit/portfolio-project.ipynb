    "Think of this project as a very first step in building your portfolio that showcases your work, skills, and interests. All code that you submit as part of this project should use the skills that you learned in this class, i.e., _we will **not** accept projects written using Pandas or advanced Python code_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project is really well-written, we will consider adapting it into a lab format in future iterations of this course (this acknowledgment could later be added to your portfolio). Do not hesitate to contact the instructor through Piazza for feedback on your notebook, before you submit it.\n",

    "The following article provides some helpful guidelines to consider when assembling your notebook. I recommend reading it before you start on the project: [A Data Science Project Style Guide\n",
    "from Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-project-style-guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following article demonstrates the type of work I expect you to do for this project: [Building a data science portfolio: Storytelling with data](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project). \"One of the most critical skills in data science is being able to tell an effective story using data. ...\n",
    "A story in the data science context is **a narrative around what you found, how you found it, and what it means**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is supposed to help you build your portfolio, this project should be an individual effort. You may discuss your ideas with your classmates and ask for help, but you should write the code yourself and submit your work individually.\n",

    "Feel free to modify this notebook and add your context and code below.\n",
    "Submit your work by December 15, 2018 at 1PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you submit your notebook, clear all output (`Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output`) and then run all cells (`Cell -> Run All`). Make sure there are no errors and that the output looks fine.\n",
